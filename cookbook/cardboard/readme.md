## Concept

### About

[Wikipedia says]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard ):

_Google Cardboard is a fold-out cardboard smartphone mount that, when combined with lenses, a magnet, a piece of hook-and-loop fastener and a rubber band and held against the face, affords a virtual reality experience. This low-cost, open-source headset is designed by Google but offered freely for people to create on their own. A smartphone with stereoscopic display software fits into this device and the lenses allow a person to perceive the images as one single three-dimensional image. The hardware was announced at Google I/O 2014._

_The official Google app that displays stereoscopic images requires WebGL support on the smartphone; phones with Chrome and WebGL can run Google's web experiments. Apple's iOS 8 will support this technology and Cardboard's official apps.[3] Third-party apps are available on the Google Play store with Cardboard support._

## Road Map

## Issues /Bugs

## System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
