_Voice Commands for Three.js ~ [Full Screen (Latest)]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/voice-commands/latest/ )_


[Voice Commands for Three.js ~ R2 (WIP / broken)]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/voice-commands/r2/voice-commands-r2.html )

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
To demonstrate the ability of voice-activated control of 3D motion within a VR app running on a mobile device 
- such as a phone embedded in a [Google Cardboard]( https://cardboard.withgoogle.com/ ) device 

### Vision  
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
To provide useful, working templates for achieving a variety of controls

## Features
<!-- and benefits -->


## Road Map
TBD

## Issues /Bugs

2014-10-30

Motion control works as anticipated on a computer, but not on a mobile device. This may have something to do with the use of the trackball control.

When you run the app locally, you will be repeatedly prompted to enable use of the microphone. 
Running on a server where htpps can kick-in significantly reduces the number of calls.

## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
